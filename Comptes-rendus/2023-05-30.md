# Report of the 30/05/2023 meeting
We did a little meeting today during which we discussed what I had worked on since the start of the internship and what I would do next.

I started by choosing to work on a profiler that would proxify methods to build a call tree that would accurately count how many times a method was called.
To do that I had to modify the MethodProxies library to make it work in concurrent scenarios by using a "metalevel" variable already used by the Reflectivity package.

Next we discussed what I was going to do next, so I have to:

1. Commit the changes to the MethodProxies lib and move the intrumentation level logic to another package
2. Add the Flame graph visualisation, that was started during the last Dojo, in my Profiler to the git
3. Find a way to include more information to the profiling by mixing/adding it to the existing Pharo time profiling library
4. Find a way to accurately profile the methods. Maybe using ASTs or by trying to profile everything
5. Make sure the system is as robust as possible (i.e. it needs to pass tests, in particular those that check that the proxies are correctly removed.
